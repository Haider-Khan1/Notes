    <h2>PGP-Encyrption</h2>

<p>PGP or Pretty Good Privacy system is an encryption system used to keep information safe when going to the sender.
    Similar to Diffie-Hellman PGP would require a public and private key. In order for a user to decrypt a message
they would require both the public and private key. The sender would send the message encrypted and once it is reached
to the revicer then the sender will use their public key and the reciver will use their private key to decrypt the message.
