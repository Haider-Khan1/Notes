<p>SQL or sequel is a language similar to python and HTML. Sequel is used in databases, so you would use this when you're working on something such as Microsoft Access.
Now, websites have to be connected to databases and what this could do is when you entered a search request for example it would pull back information from the database.
That's a great idea, however some programming languages are more vulnerable to this and one of those languages was PHP.
PHP is a great language, it's user friendly and similar to English language. Numerous websites first started out being written in PHP.
Now, I'll use PHP for example. To essentianly make this work you could write SQL into anythng such as a comment section or login page and break the website.
Since SQL is used in databases you could do a simple command such as "SELECT * FROM USERS HAIDER"; DROP ALL DATABASES"
The database will read this command and say that's exactly what I should do. This also ties in with browsers and the browsers will just run it.
Most modern day browsers now block people from going to the web when vulnerable to SQL injection.
