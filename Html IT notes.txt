plans for the website
(My IT journey)
add the geometrical shapes from the website backtrack-linux.org
(add your own twist to it)(uses Java Script)
fix the coloring and the background when testing it
finish the notes with some of the things (signal jamming, arp spoofing and ssl striping, using aircrack-ng
add onto notes (MAC, Nmap, etc). 
Find info on powercert animated videos. 
add multiple sections, rather than 1 big section
add seperate pages
organize the code, and add notes to what certains parts of the code do
after being comfortable with HTML and CSS, start learning PHP, and JS
don't directly copy and paste code without
1. understanding what it does
2. adding your own twist to it, unless it has what you need
3. No need to use all their code, just unnessecary
TRY HARDER
